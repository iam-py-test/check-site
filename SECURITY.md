# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The versions which security issues can be submitted for. I do not support 1.0.0 because it was the _very first_ release. Anyone still using it should upgrade.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.1   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.2.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.1   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, open an issue and select _Security issue report_.<br>
If this must be done privatly, I can:
1. Privatly send you my email
2. Create a private repo & share it
If that is needed, open an issue and say so. Please _only_ use this for issues which _must not_ be made public or which contain sensitive information.<br>
If this becomes a point of abuse, I will require all security issues to be public
